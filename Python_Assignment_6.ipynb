    "In Python, variables are used to store data values. Here are the rules for creating variables in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "Naming Rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "Variable names must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_).\n",
    "The subsequent characters in the variable name can be letters, underscores, or digits (0-9).\n",
    "Variable names are case-sensitive, meaning myVariable and myvariable are treated as two different variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Allowed Characters:\n",
    "\n",
    "Variable names can only contain letters, underscores, and digits. Special characters like @, #, $, etc., are not allowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keywords:\n",
    "\n",
    "Variable names cannot be the same as Python keywords (reserved words). For example, you cannot name a variable if, for, while, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoid Using Built-in Names:\n",
    "\n",
    "It's generally a good practice to avoid using names of built-in functions or classes as variable names. For example, don't name a variable print, as it conflicts with the built-in print() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Descriptive and Readable:\n",
    "\n",
    "It's a good practice to use descriptive names that indicate the purpose of the variable. This makes your code more readable and maintainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Snake Case:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python conventionally uses snake_case for variable names, where words are separated by underscores. For example: my_variable, user_name, total_count.\n",
    "\n",
    "Numbers at the Start:\n",
    "\n",
    "While variable names can contain digits, they cannot start with a digit. For example, 123var is not a valid variable name.\n",
    "\n",
    "And here are some examples of invalid variable names:\n",
    "\n",
    "2var = \"Invalid\"    # Variable name can't start with a digit\n",
    "\n",
    "if = 5              # Can't use a Python keyword as a variable name\n",

The conventions help other programmers (and your future self) understand the purpose and context of variables. While there's no strict \"official\" convention, the PEP 8 style guide provides widely accepted recommendations. Here are some key points from PEP 8 for variable naming:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Descriptive Names:\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose variable names that are meaningful and describe the purpose of the variable. This improves code readability and understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Snake Case for Variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use lowercase letters and separate words with underscores to form variable names. For example: total_count, user_name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoid Single Character Names (Mostly):\n",
    "\n",
    "While single-letter variable names like i, j, x, etc., are common in loops and mathematical formulas, it's better to use more descriptive names in other cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use All Uppercase for Constants:\n",
    "\n",
    "If a variable is intended to be a constant (a value that shouldn't change), use uppercase letters and underscores to separate words. For example: MAX_SIZE, DEFAULT_VALUE.\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoid Ambiguous Names:\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose names that clearly convey the purpose of the variable. Avoid names like temp, data, or value, as they don't provide enough context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Be Consistent:\n",
    "\n",
    "Maintain consistency in your naming conventions throughout your codebase. If you're working with a team, follow the conventions agreed upon by the team.\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoid Reserved Words:\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't use Python keywords or built-in function names as variable names.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Nouns for Variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables typically represent objects, values, or data. Use nouns or noun phrases for variable names.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Verb-Noun Pairs for Functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're defining functions, consider using verb-noun pairs to describe what the function does. For example: calculate_total(), validate_input().\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoid Underscores at the Start/End:\n",
    "\n",
    "While using underscores to separate words is common, avoid starting or ending variable names with underscores (unless they have special meaning, like some Python-specific names).\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoid Abbreviations in Most Cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "Aim for clarity over brevity. While some common abbreviations (like num for number) might be acceptable, avoid excessive use of abbreviations that might confuse readers."
